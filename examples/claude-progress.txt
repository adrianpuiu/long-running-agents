## Session 1 - 2025-11-27 10:00 UTC (Initializer)

### Session Type
Initializer session - project scaffolding and comprehensive feature extraction

### Context
User requested a trading analytics dashboard that integrates with their railpath-finance-toolkit skill. Project designed to demonstrate long-running-agent harness with realistic complexity.

### Work Completed
1. Created project directory structure
2. Generated comprehensive feature_list.json with 42 features across 6 categories
3. Created init.sh development startup script customized for React + FastAPI stack
4. Initialized git repository

### Feature Categories Defined
- **Infrastructure (F001-F003, F042)**: Server setup, database, logging
- **Security (F004-F006)**: Auth, JWT, protected routes
- **UI (F007-F008, F016-F018, F020-F021, F023-F024, F028, F030, F032-F033, F037-F040)**: All frontend pages
- **Functional (F009-F013, F019, F022, F025-F027, F029, F031, F034-F035)**: Core business logic
- **Integration (F014-F015, F036)**: External APIs, WebSocket
- **Performance (F041)**: Response time requirements

### Tech Stack Decisions
- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite + TailwindCSS + Recharts
- **Backend**: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + SQLite
- **Auth**: JWT with python-jose
- **Price Data**: Yahoo Finance (yfinance) - free, no API key needed
- **Quant Calcs**: railpath-finance-toolkit integration planned

### Files Created
- `feature_list.json` - 42 features, all passes: false
- `claude-progress.txt` - This file
- `init.sh` - Development startup script

### Commits Made
- [pending] - "Initial project scaffold with feature list"

### Handover Notes for Next Session
- **Priority**: F001 (FastAPI backend) and F002 (React frontend) - get both servers running
- **Blockers**: None
- **Warnings**: Need to install Node.js deps and Python deps on first real run
- **Environment state**: Clean scaffold only - no actual code yet

### Recommended Session 2 Approach
1. Run `./init.sh` (will fail until code exists - that's expected)
2. Create FastAPI backend skeleton with health endpoint
3. Create React frontend skeleton with Vite
4. Verify both servers start
5. Mark F001 and F002 as passing
